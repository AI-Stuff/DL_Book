# DL_Book
Hey, I am uploading my notes on github since it is hard to find a detailed good summary. My notes skip over some basic things sometimes, 
so in order to use them efficiently, it is probably beneficial to understand how the architecture works in general. The notes can then 
elaborate on that and be used for math and more in-depth stuff. I am planning on finishing the book, and I will be releasing my notes as 
I continue.
